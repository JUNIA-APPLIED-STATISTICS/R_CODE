# Welcome to the Github Platform of this course
Here, I will post the script code before the lessons together with supplementary material 

##1. Descriptive Statistics
Setting up software and downloading files

1) Create a floder on your laptop e.g. "Applied Statistics"
2) Create a folder in the "Applied Statistics" folder called "RAW_DATA"
3) [Download the four datasets from the PROMOTE Birth Cohort 3 Randomized Controlled Trial to the "RAW_DATA" folder](https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_8786631aaf/new/variables/EUPATH_0000096/EUPATH_0015457)
4) [Download R if you don't have it on your computer](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
5) [Download RStudio if you don't have it on your computer](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
6) If you do not have an unzipping tool [Download 7-zip](https://www.7-zip.fr/)
7) [Link to the publication](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)32224-4/fulltext)

You can check which version of Windows you have by pressing windows icon button+R simulateously, and writing in the search bar: winver
You can check which version of mac os you have from the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen, choose About This Mac

You can then download the code from this reposatory, save it in the "Applied Statistics" folder locally on your computer and start working on it. 
Happy coding!
